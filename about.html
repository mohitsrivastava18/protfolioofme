      <p>
        Hello! I'm Mohit Srivastava, currently pursuing my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) at Presidency College, Bangalore, and presently in my second semester. With a growing passion for software development and problem-solving, I’m building a strong foundation in both core programming and advanced computing concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have sound knowledge of C, C++, Java, and SQL, along with practical experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end web development. I’ve designed and deployed several web projects using Netlify, focusing on responsive design and user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
      As part of my MCA curriculum, I’ve studied and worked on concepts in Artificial Intelligence, Database Management Systems, Computer Networks, Operating Systems, and Cybersecurity. These subjects have broadened my understanding of both system-level and application-level computing, enabling me to approach problems with both technical and analytical perspectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside academics, I’m a creative thinker who enjoys writing poetry and stories. This not only sharpens my imagination but also enhances my communication and design sensibilities. I strongly believe in blending logic with creativity, and I’m always eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to meaningful tech projects and innovative environments.
